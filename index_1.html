                    <h2>Introduction</h2>

                    <p>Josef Müller Brockmann is undoubtedly one of the most influencers designers in the world. The way that he approached design was so different from anything that the world had seen before. Personally he has really influenced me as a designer and opened my mind to new ways of doing things that I would never have thought of. In this I will talk about some of the fundamentals he followed and the impact they along with his work had on me and continues to inspire me.</p>
                </section>

                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>Müller-Brockmann was born in 1914 and grew up in Switzerland before attending the University of Zurich. In 1936 he opened his first studio in Zurich. He became one of the leading theorists of Swiss Style. He worked for many different clients throughout his career but most notably the Zurich Tonhalle. With his posters for Musica Viva. These posters have become infamous as some of Müller-Brockmann’s most notable work. Later in his career he replaced Ernst Keller as the professor of graphic design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich. He also co-created a magazine called “Neue Grafik/New Graphic Design” with designers such as Richard Paul Lohse, Hans Neuburg and Carlo Vivarelli. After that in 1967 he became a consultant for IBM and created his own communication agency called Müller-Brockmann &amp; Co. Before he died in Zurich on 30th August 1996. As you can see Müller-Brockmann lived a very interesting life and contributed to many different projects. His approach and drive where one of the things that got him to be the designer he was and as popular as he was.</p>

                <h2>Swiss Style</h2>

                <p>Swiss Style is often considered as the “evolution of modern design” and Müller-Brockmann was considered one of the pioneers of this era of the Swiss school of international style. This was an interesting time with Constructivism and the Bauhaus pushing Müller-Brockmann into a new way of doing things that really opened himself up to creative expression within his work. How he approached his designs always depended on the needs of whatever the project was. I find this interesting as when I am working on projects myself this makes me think am I adapting to the needs of the project? Or am I letting an initial idea I had take over and spending too much time on that. I think that what Müller-Brockmann thought about this is incredibly relevant as the content you are trying to get across is the whole reason you are designing it in the first place. He was also a big fan of using geometric shapes and not afraid to use negative space in his work. This is another aspect of his work that inspires me as often it can seem like we need to fill the entire page but it doesn’t have to be like this and for Müller-Brockmann he was really ahead of his time with minimalistic style as it has become a massive thing in this modern age.</p>

                <h2>The Grid System</h2>

                <p>In 1981 Müller-Brockmann published a book titled. “Grid Systems in Graphic Design”. The description of this book reads “A Handbook for Graphic Artists, Typographers, and Exhibition Designers” and he is exactly right when he says this as this book is an extensive guide to </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.”<br> <span class="quote_author"> – Josef Müller-Brockmann</span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Construct of Type</h2>

                <p>When I first started designing and for a while afterwards I would have designed first and then afterwards I would look at the text or content that needed to be put into it and tried to fit it in anyway that I could. But Müller-Brockmann looked at this idea of that before the type area can be determined, the designer must know how much text and illustrations are needed.
                    Zurich Town Hall Theater Production Posters</p>

                <p>Some of what are considered Müller-Brockmann greatest pieces of work came from his time working with the Zurich tonhalle for their range of “Musica viva” posters. This collection of concept posters he created really have influenced me in different ways. Firstly the simplicity Müller-Brockmann uses throughout this collection of designs shows me how using typography and minimal graphics is a really interesting approach to design. It also shows us his content first approach to design.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The work is graphic, rather than illustrative. Some critics say these posters created a mathematical harmony, which reflected the harmony of music.” <br> <span class="quote_author"> - Speider Schneider</span></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>I thought this quote was really interesting as it is referring to how Müller-Brockmann approaches his work by adapting to the needs of the project. The mathematical approach that he took for this project really interests me. In this piece in particular.</p>
